# Pre-Prod Checklist
- [ ] Use a ground fill front and back
- [ ] Orientation of ProMicro antenna and clearance to ground fill as well as the battery
- [ ] Make vcc and ground traces .3 instead of .2 mil
- [ ] Use choc spacing.
- [ ] Also, Kailh choc red & browns have too much resistance(!) - they are both 50g.
- [ ] Bigger traces generally. 
- [ ] Add (minor) column stagger to the outermost column (2nd pinky row) - possibly remove the topmost key on that column
- [ ] Gateron KS-33 banana switches.
